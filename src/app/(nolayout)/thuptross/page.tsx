                        TheHigherUps Project to Release Open Source Software
                        aims to catalyze a movement towards liberating
                        open-source software (OSS) from the constraints of
                        proprietary licensing. It seeks to address the growing
                        concerns within the software development community
                        regarding the accessibility, transparency, and
                        inclusivity of OSS by advocating for the adoption of
                        more permissive licenses. This project recognizes the
                        fundamental importance of open-source principles in
                        fostering innovation, collaboration, and equitable
                        access to technology.
